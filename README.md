<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the clone
The aim of this clone is to improve the [BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group)](https://big.dk/) website which is made with wordpress, a custom plugin and the Canvas API and which lacks of responsiveness, accesibility performance and SEO based on the lighthouse report.

This clone also help me to get a workaround to the `flex-direction: column;` css problem.

### Improvements

 * Improved lighthouse report
 * Semantic elements.
 * SEO improved.
 * Responsive design that works with mobile, tablet and desktop.
 * Search bar for projects.
 * Each project has it's own page (SEO improvement) with it's own slug based on the project name provided in the headless CMS.
 * Color contrasts corrected.


### Made with
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
* [react-easy-flip](https://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip)
* [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/)

* [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as a Headless CMS => [repository](https://github.com/francoromanol/big.dk-clone_server)

2. Install packages on client and headless cms

3. In `.env.local` file (client)
    ```sh
    CMS_HOST= [CMS HOST]
    CMS_LOCALHOST= 'http://localhost:1337'
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_LOCALHOST=$CMS_LOCALHOST
    ```
4. In `.env` (headless cms)
    ```sh

    PORT=1337
    CLOUDINARY_NAME = [CLOUDINARY NAME]

    CLOUDINARY_SECRET = [CLOUDINARY SECRET]
    ```
